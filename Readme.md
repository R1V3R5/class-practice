## Objectives

* Obtain further knowledge of how Constructors & Prototypes work, while utilizing the newer Class syntax.

## Normal Mode

In the example file below make sure you name each class differently as to not override each other. I need to be able to test them deployed on the console. Also make sure there are no JavaScript errors and check your code. Finally make sure it is formatted/indented correctly. Code is in place that validates each answer. It will currently say: `Assertion failed` for each question. Once you answer the question correctly that will go away. Use this to check your work.

1. Copy the contents of the source file below into YOUR OWN `main.js` file.
2. Complete each question (and the bonus if you want)
3. Deploy the application to Surge.

## Deliverables

1. Submit your Github Repo URL
2. Deploy to Surge.sh and put a link in your `Readme.md` file
